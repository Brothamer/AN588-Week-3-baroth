# Homework 02: Titis in the Mist…

```{r image, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='24%', fig.cap='Titi monkeys twining tails'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/brook/OneDrive/Documents/2023_Fall/AN588/AN588-Week-3-baroth/titis.jpg")
```

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the **mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15**. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

* Use a Poisson function because we are modeling the number of counts based only on an expected mean.

## Q1: What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

* Use the ppois() function to get a cumulative probability for all numbers of calls up to 8 calls. 

* Use 1 - ppois() to get the cumulative probability of more than 8 rather than less than 8.
```{r more than 8}
over8 <- 1- ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15) - #q is the number of calls we want to know about #lambda is the expected mean
  dpois(x=8, lambda=15) #subtract the probability of hearing exactly 8 calls
over8
```
## Q2: What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

* Use dpois() to get the probability of an exact number of calls (0).
```{r no calls}
nocalls <- dpois(x = 0, lambda = 15) #x is the number of calls we want to know about #lambda is the expected mean
nocalls
```
## Q3: What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

* Use dpois() to get the probability of an exact number of calls (3).
```{r exactly 3}
exactly3 <- dpois(x = 3, lambda = 15) #x is the number of calls we want to know about #lambda is the expected mean
exactly3
```

## Q4: Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

* Use dpois to plot the probability of each number of calls for all integers 0 though 30.
```{r plot}
plot <- dpois(x = 0:30, lambda = 15)
barplot(plot, names.arg = 0:30, space = 0, 
        xlab = "Number of calls", ylab = "Probability of # of calls observed", 
        main = "Titi Calls: Poisson Mass Function")
```

## Q5: Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

* Use rpois() to similate random numbers using a Poisson mass function
```{r simulate}
set.seed(24) # Set seed for random number generation so it runs the same random numbers every time
#Can be any number; I like 24
  
N <- 104 # Set sample size for number of results
  
simulated <- rpois(N, lambda = 15) # Calling rpois() Function and setting the expected mean to 15
simulated
```

## Q6: Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r plot simulate}
simulatedplot <- hist(simulated, freq = FALSE, xlim = range(0:30), 
                      xlab = "Number of calls", ylab = "Relative frequency", 
                      main = "Titi Calls: Poison Simulation Histogram")
```
The plots look similar with the highest density occurring at or just under 15. The sample size of 104 may be small because the histogram has a less smooth appearance, particularly with there being less instances of 15 calls than 

# Five challenges in completing this assignment.

1. First of all, I panicked and my mind went blank of everything about all the different mass functions are supposed to represent or how to use them. I can't remember what Sam said, but she said something that made it all click back into place.
2. I had to remember that ppois() uses q where dpois() uses x in the arguments. Before that, i was getting an error in running ppois().
3. Looking back over the modules, I could not remember or find how to simulate random numbers from a probability function. I googled it and found a solution at [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compute-randomly-drawn-poisson-density-in-r-programming-rpois-function/).
4. My histogram was measuring the x-axis as frequency/counts and I wanted to figure out how to make it display relative frequency. I tried a couple alternatives but they did relative frequency as percent which wasn't necessarily what I wanted. I eventually figured this out as described below.
5. My histogram is putting the x-axis values in buckets of 2 and I wish it wouldn't and I need to figure out how to fix that. 

# Three things I learned from the peer commentary

1. I learned how to caption my image. I also tried, as Paige recommended, to link it to the image in my github instead of the file on my computer, but then the image didn't work,
2. I learned that in the first question, I need to make sure to subtract the probability of getting 8 since the question only asks for the probability of getting more than 8.
3. While reviewing Amanda's code, I realized that she and I had interpreted the output of the histogram differently (frequency/counts vs relative frequency/probability). This helped me figure out how to change my histogram, by adding the freq = FALSE argument, to show probability so that it is more directly comparable to the barplot.

# Two things I like in my peers' work

1. Paige's annotations of how to answer question 1 were clear and useful.
2. Amanda's use of the upper.tri argument was a good reminder that that is another option.
